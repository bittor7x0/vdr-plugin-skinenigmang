See the file COPYING for license information.


Requirements
------------

- VDR version >= 1.4.0.

- Logo pack from http://andreas.vdr-developer.org/enigmang


Description
-----------

"EnigmaNG" is a standalone skin based on the "Enigma" text2skin addon.


Compile time configuration
--------------------------

There are some configuration items you need to set before running
"make plugins" in "Make.config":

SKINENIGMA_HAVE_EPGSEARCH = 1
If you are using the epgsearch plugin and want to see the number of
timer conflicts in the main menu's info area.

SKINENIGMA_NO_MENULOGO = 1
This turns usage of logos in the main menu complete. This might also
improve the performance of the menus. EXPERIMENTAL!!!


Patches
-------

In the patches directory you'll find patches that might be of interest
to you before compiling. Just check it out!
Every patch (*.diff) has a corresponding description (*.txt). Read it
for more information.

Setup Options
-------------

- Show auxiliary information top/bottom
  Here you can set where you want to have the auxiliary information
	when you open an event's or recording's info screen. This information
	includes for a recording its channel, size, priority, lifetime, audio
	languages and some values that selected plugins (epgsearch, VDRAdmin-AM,
	pin) have set. For an event the audio languages are shown.

- Show remaining/elapsed time
  Here you can set if you want to read the number of minutes an event is
	already running (preceded by "+") or the number of minutes an event will
	run (preceded by "-") in the channel info.

- Show symbols in lists
  This replaces "T", "t", "V"... in the EPG views symbols.

- Show progressbar
  This replaces progressbars shown with pipes (e.g. [||  ]) by a graphical
	progressbar.

- Show symbols
  Here you can enable or disable the large symbols shown in top right corner
	of the main menu, the recordings info and the event info and the "background"
	symbol of the mode symbol when replaying recordings.

- Show info area in main menu
  This info area is shown in the main menu and it will show the current/next
	timers and the number of timer conflicts (if SKINENIGMA_HAVE_EPGSEARCH has been defined).

- Show marker in lists
  If enabled a small circle is drawn in front of the selected item in lists.

- Show VPS
  Hide or show VPS information in channel info and event info.
  

- Show channel logos
  Hide or show channel logos in channel info.

- Identify channel by name/data
  Here you can choose if the channel logo should be searched by the channel's
	name (e.g. "YLETV2" -> "YLETV2.xpm") or by the channel's unique id (e.g.
	"T-8438-4097-33.xpm").
	NOTE: the available logo packs are named by channel name only!

- Channel logo cache size
  The number of logos/symbols to keep in the cache.


Notes
-----

- Only XPM format is supported for channel logos: 80x80 pixels and
  13 colors (6 colors on DXR3) or less recommended.

- If you'll add new channels logos on the fly, remember to flush the
  channel logo cache.
